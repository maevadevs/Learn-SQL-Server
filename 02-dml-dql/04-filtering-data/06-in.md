# `IN`

Checks whether a value matches any value in a list or a subquery

- The subquery is a `SELECT` statement that returns a list of values of a single column
- **If a list contains `NULL`, the result of `IN` for that instance will be `UNKNOWN`**

```sql
column|expression IN (v1, v2, v3, ...|subquery)
```

- All the values/subquery returns must have the same type as the type of the column or expression
- If a value in the column or the expression is equal to any value in the list, the result of the `IN` operator is `TRUE`
- **The `IN` operator is equivalent to multiple `OR` operators**

```sql
-- These 2 are equivalent
Column IN (v1, v2, v3)
Column = v1 OR Column = v2 OR Column = v3
```

## `NOT IN`

Returns the complement set for `IN`

```sql
column|expression NOT IN (v1, v2, v3, ...|subquery)
```

## Examples `IN` and `NOT IN`

We can use a list of constant values

```sql
SELECT 
    Product_Name, 
    List_Price
FROM Production.Products
WHERE List_Price IN (
    89.99, 
    109.99, 
    159.99
)
ORDER BY List_Price;
```

This is equivalent to the following using multiple `OR`

```sql
SELECT 
    Product_Name, 
    List_Price
FROM Production.Products
WHERE List_Price = 89.99 
    OR List_Price = 109.99 
    OR List_Price = 159.99
ORDER BY List_Price;
```

We can use `NOT IN` for the complement set

```sql
SELECT 
    Product_Name, 
    List_Price
FROM Production.Products
WHERE List_Price NOT IN (
    89.99, 
    109.99, 
    159.99
)
ORDER BY List_Price;
```

We can also use a subquery

```sql
SELECT
    Product_Name, 
    List_Price
FROM Production.Products
WHERE Product_Id IN (
    SELECT Product_Id
    FROM Production.Stocks
    WHERE Store_Id = 1 
        AND Quantity >= 30
)
ORDER BY Product_Name;
```

- The subquery returned a list of `Product_Id`
- The outer query retrieved the `Product_Name` and `List_Price` of the products whose `Product_Id` matches any value returned by the subquery

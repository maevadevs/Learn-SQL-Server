# `OR`

---

- [Examples `OR`](#examples-or)

---

- Combine two Boolean expressions
- Return `FALSE` *if and only if* **all** expressions are `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`, otherwise return `TRUE`
- If any expression is `TRUE`, always return `TRUE`
  - `TRUE OR UNKNOWN -> TRUE`
  - `FALSE OR UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN`
  - `UNKNOWN OR UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN`

```sql
boolean_expression OR boolean_expression
```

## Examples `OR`

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM Production.Products
 WHERE Category_Id = 1
       OR List_Price > 400
 ORDER BY List_Price DESC;
```

- We can use multiple conditions with `OR`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Production.Products
WHERE Category_Id = 1
      OR List_Price > 400
      OR Brand_Id = 1
ORDER BY List_Price DESC;
```

But we can also replace multiple `OR` with `IN` if the conditions apply on the same column

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM Production.Products
 WHERE Category_Id = 1
       OR List_Price > 400
       OR Brand_Id = 1
 ORDER BY List_Price DESC;
```

- So this is equivalent to the following

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM Production.Products
 WHERE Category_Id IN (1, 2, 3)
 ORDER BY List_Price DESC;
```

- We can also combine with other logical operators
  - **`AND` takes precedence over `OR`**
  - If we want to be explicit on the order of priority, we can wrap the conditions inside parentheses

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM Production.Products
 WHERE (Brand_Id = 1 OR Brand_Id = 2 )
       AND List_Price > 1000
 ORDER BY Brand_Id DESC;
```

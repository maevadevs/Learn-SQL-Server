# `IN`

Checks whether a value matches any value in a list or a subquery

- The subquery is a `SELECT` statement that returns a list of values of a single column
- **If a list contains `NULL`, the result of `IN` for that instance will be `UNKNOWN`**

```sql
column|expression IN (v1, v2, v3, ...|subquery)
```

- All the values/subquery returns must have the same type as the type of the column or expression
- If a value in the column or the expression is equal to any value in the list, the result of the `IN` operator is `TRUE`
- **The `IN` operator is equivalent to multiple `OR` operators**

```sql
-- These 2 are equivalent
column IN (v1, v2, v3)
column = v1 OR column = v2 OR column = v3
```

## `NOT IN`

Returns the complement set for `IN`

```sql
column|expression NOT IN (v1, v2, v3, ...|subquery)
```

## Examples `IN` and `NOT IN`

We can use a list of constant values

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price IN (
    89.99, 
    109.99, 
    159.99
)
ORDER BY list_price;
```

This is equivalent to the following using multiple `OR`

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price = 89.99 
    OR list_price = 109.99 
    OR list_price = 159.99
ORDER BY list_price;
```

We can use `NOT IN` for the complement set

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price NOT IN (
    89.99, 
    109.99, 
    159.99
)
ORDER BY list_price;
```

We can also use a subquery

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM production.stocks
    WHERE store_id = 1 
        AND quantity >= 30
)
ORDER BY product_name;
```

- The subquery returned a list of `product_id`
- The outer query retrieved the `product_name` and `list_price` of the products whose `product_id` matches any value returned by the subquery

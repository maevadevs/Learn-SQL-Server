# `OR`

Combine two Boolean expressions and return `FALSE` if and only if **all** expressions are `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`, otherwise return `TRUE`

- If any expression is `TRUE`, always return `TRUE`
  - `TRUE OR UNKNOWN -> TRUE`
  - `FALSE OR UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN`
  - `UNKNOWN OR UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN`

```sql
boolean_expression OR boolean_expression
```

## Examples `OR`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM production.products
WHERE category_id = 1
    OR list_price > 400
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

We can use multiple conditions with `OR`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM production.products
WHERE category_id = 1
    OR list_price > 400
    OR brand_id = 1
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

But we can also replace multiple `OR` with `IN` if the conditions apply on the same column

```sql
SELECT *
FROM production.products
WHERE category_id = 1
    OR category_id = 2
    OR category_id = 3
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

So this is equivalent to the following

```sql
SELECT *
FROM production.products
WHERE category_id IN (1, 2, 3)
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

- We can also combine with other logical operators
  - **`AND` takes precedence over `OR`**
  - If we want to be explicit on the order of priority, we can wrap the conditions inside parentheses

```sql
SELECT *
FROM production.products
WHERE 
    (brand_id = 1 OR brand_id = 2)
    AND list_price > 1000
ORDER BY brand_id DESC;
```
